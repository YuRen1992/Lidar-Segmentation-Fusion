# Lidar-Segmentation-Fusion

<font size="4">
Here we provide a workflow, including individual tree segmentation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)/airborne data and backpack/Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data, and a multi-platform data fusion method based on tree locations. These algorithms were previously developed by us and implemented in C++. For details on the algorithms for each section, please refer to the references at the end of the readme.

Individual tree segmentation of UAV and backpack lidar data 
===

### 1. Individual tree segmentation of UAV lidar data

Within the `tree segmentation`folder, `PointCloudTreeSegmentationUAV.h`serves as the interface for the individual tree segmentation algorithm based on UAV lidar data `(with comments containing examples)`. An example of how to call it  is as following:

```cpp
 //Example Invocation  (it is recommended to thin the point cloud first).

 PointCloudTreeSegmentation::PtCloud ptVec(filterClouds.size());
//Individual tree segmentation
 PointCloudTreeSegmentation pcs_segmentation;
 pcs_segmentation.SetPara(2.0);
 pcs_segmentation.SetCurBox(worldbox.xMinimum(), worldbox.xMaximum(), worldbox.yMinimum(), worldbox.yMaximum());
 pcs_segmentation.setHeightAbouveGround(m_para->HeightAbouveGround);
 pcs_segmentation.SetMinTreeHeight(m_para->MinTreeHeight);

 std::vector<PointCloudTreeSegmentation::st_treeAtt>trees;
 unsigned int treeid = 0;
 if (pcs_segmentation.RunSegmentation(ptVec, trees)) {
	 ······
 }

 //Export csv
 std::string myFilePath = "yourname.csv";
 pcs_segmentation.outputToCSV(trees, myFilePath); 
```

### 2. Individual tree segmentation of backpack lidar data

Within the `tree segmentation` folder, `PointCloudTreeSegmentationBackpack.h` serves as the interface for the individual tree segmentation algorithm based on backpack lidar data `(with comments containing examples)`. An example of how to call it is as following:

```cpp
//Example Invocation 
//Assign a value to ptVec
PointCloudTreeSegmentation::PtCloud ptVec(IOPointCloud.size());

//Set parameters and run
CTLSPointCloudTreeSegmentation::CTLSPointCloudTreeSegmentationPara myPara;
CTLSPointCloudTreeSegmentation pcoTreeSegmentation(myPara);
pcoTreeSegmentation.doSegment(ptVec);

//Export csv
std::string myFilePath = cloudObject0->getFullPath();
liBase::renameExt(myFilePath, std::string(".csv"));
pcoTreeSegmentation.outputToCSV(myFilePath);

```

Fusion of multiplatform lidar data based on tree locations
===
Based on the individual tree segmentation results from both UAV and backpack lidar, data fusion is performed based on tree locations, with the main program being `\registration\registration_no_GUI.cpp`. This program contains detailed code comments, allowing users to adjust parameters according to their own data.
In the `Test data` folder, there are test datasets, including `backpack.las` and `UAV.las` for lidar data. `B_tree` and `U_tree` represent tree location data from backpack and UAV data sources, respectively.
